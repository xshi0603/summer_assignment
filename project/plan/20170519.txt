Which jobs are most crucial?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MVP:

- Enemies spawn in waves and target the player or nexus based on vicinity
- Player can kill enemies
- Enemies drop gold on death
- Shop with weapons the player can purchase
- Gameover if the player or nexus dies

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Player movement and shooting
- Enemy targeting and attacking
- Bullets deal damage to enemies

Which components are prerequisites for others?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Bullets are necessary for the player and turret to shoot
- Weapons are required for the player to deal damage
- Shop requires weapons, turrets, or traps for the player to buy items/structures
- Enemies require a player or structure to target during pathing
- Gold requires an enemy to drop gold on death

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Player Movement, Enemy AI, Placement of Structures, and Shop HUD should be
approached together

- Can be delegated:
  - Game Manager
  - Player shooting
  - Enemy skeleton
  - Enemies dropping gold
  - Turret shooting and targeting
  - Trap creation

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We plan on finishing the MVP by May 27th. By testing the game and bug fixing over the
weekend, we will be able to decide if we want to make any major changes to the game.
Then we will work on the shop, turrets, traps, highscore, and placement until May 2nd. This gives
us 3 days to polish the game and bug fix.

Shop:
- Create a GUI that displays the nexus' HP
- Add buttons for the weapons
  - Description
  - Price
- Add functionality

Turrets:
- Create an object that can automatically shoot enemies based on a queue proritized by distance
- Add button to GUI that allows player to buy turret
- Figure out how to place turret on map

Trap:
- Create an object that deals damage when an enemy walks on top of it
- Add button to GUI that allows player to buy trap
- Create stack based on position

Highscore:
- Calculate the score based on what wave the player reached
- Add the score to the CSV file when the game ends
- Run a sort on the values in the CSV file to order them


If we have time:
- Add upgrade buttons
- More enemies

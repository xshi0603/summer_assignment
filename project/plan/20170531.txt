- Gold requires an enemy to drop gold on death (completed)

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Player Movement, Enemy AI, Placement of Structures, and Shop HUD should be
approached together

- Can be delegated:
  - Game Manager
  - Player shooting
  - Enemy skeleton
  - Enemies dropping gold
  - Turret shooting and targeting
  - Displaying health bars
  - Gridding
    - Turret creation
    - Trap creation
      - We plan on creating a grid on the screen to use for testing but when the traps/towers function properly, they can be removed.
  - Graphics
  - High scores

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We plan on finishing the MVP by May 27th. By testing the game and bug fixing over the
weekend, we will be able to decide if we want to make any major changes to the game.
Then we will work on the shop, turrets, traps, highscore, and placement until May 2nd. This gives
us 3 days to polish the game and bug fix.

Shop:
/*
- Create a GUI that displays the nexus' HP
- Add buttons for the weapons
  - Description
  - Price
- Add functionality
*/

- Accessible on the bottom of the screen where you will be able to purchase weapons, turrets and traps.

Turrets:
- Create an object that can automatically shoot enemies based on a queue proritized by distance
- Add button to GUI that allows player to buy turret
- Figure out how to place turret on map

Trap:
- Create an object that deals damage when an enemy walks on top of it
- Add button to GUI that allows player to buy trap
- Create stack based on position

Highscore:
- Calculate the score based on what wave the player reached
- Add the score to the CSV file when the game ends
- Run a sort on the values in the CSV file to order them


If we have time:
- Add upgrade buttons
- More enemies

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As of 5/30/17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tasks Still required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Create buttons for shop functionality
- Create traps
- Create a highscore system
- Implement waves

If we have time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- create an upgrade system
- create more enemies
- create a variety of traps

Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We expect to have the buttons completed by the end of the 31st and the traps done by the 3rd. This gives us the weekend to implement a highscore system and waves. We then have a couple more days to work on polishing up loose ends and working on variety.
